### UI issues

##### Company list is needed inside most of the tabs

Current design is to have most of the elements that need the list to respond and send events to the event stream setup globally for this session.

##### Need to create widgets to manage the modules.

##### Widgets

##### A list widget to manage elements in the list. Similar to entitlements list.

##### A general query form for a record: 
###### A list box to keep track for all the records for a given entity.
###### A general form with elements for single entity data entry.
###### A search box to filter out the elements inside list.


###### Search form design
		* Search form needs to allow for a general search of elements that are indexed by a server search engine.
		* Dynamic search to allow each keystroke to help narrow the search elements.
