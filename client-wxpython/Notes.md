#### Design alternatives
Prefer to use haxe for everything. But it seems that there are too many components that we need to bring in. Or maybe I dont understand it yet. 
Will review.

#### The reasons for using haxe are compelling:

* Support for promises
* Statically typed.

#### How to test using the shell 

libreoffice --accept="socket,host=localhost,port=2002,urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager'
