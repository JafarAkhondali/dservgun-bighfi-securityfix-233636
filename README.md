## CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) aka stresstests is a model to evaluate a portfolio risk. This project provides a place to manage this for a user.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/ccar-websockets](https://assembly.com/ccar-websockets).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
