### UI Guidelines

#### Selecting of a parent entity should return the details, for example, when 
the drop down list of companies in the project ui is selected, retrieve the 
company details.

### Retrieving details that are not visible
As the model can be spread across multiple elements, charts etc, only the visible 
elements need to trigger a model refresh from the server.

### Keyboard access map
All events need to be accessed by the keyboard depending on the type of the 
device. User should be able to configure their keyboard map.


#### Notes
Security, permissions, ownership for data need to be controlled. This can only be done 
as mix of server and client interaction: server and client need to conclude that an interaction
is allowed for the user.
